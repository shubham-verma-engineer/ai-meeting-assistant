# Meeting Bot (stub)
This folder is a placeholder for the meeting join bot. You can implement it using:
- Playwright / Selenium (Node or Python)
- Zoom SDK (where supported)
- It should accept POST /join with meeting details, join the call, record audio, upload to object storage and notify the backend.

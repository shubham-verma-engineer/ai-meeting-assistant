# ðŸ¤– AI Meeting Assistant and Task Follow-Up Agent

## Overview

The **AI Meeting Assistant and Task Follow-Up Agent** is an intelligent, end-to-end automation tool that enhances meeting productivity by automatically joining virtual meetings, transcribing conversations, generating structured Minutes of Meeting (MoM), assigning follow-up tasks, and tracking their completion. It also provides end-of-day (EOD) and on-demand progress reports.

Built using **Java and Spring Boot**, this modular and scalable system seamlessly integrates with calendar systems, video conferencing platforms, and team communication tools.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

### âœ… Auto-Join Meetings
- Parses Google/Outlook calendar invites
- Automatically joins Zoom, Google Meet, or MS Teams using a bot client
- Starts recording and transcription

### âœ… Transcription & MoM Generation
- Uses Whisper or other STT engines to transcribe recorded audio
- Sends transcript to GPT-4 (or equivalent) to extract:
  - Meeting summary
  - Key decisions
  - Action items with assignees and due dates

### âœ… Task Assignment & Notifications
- Assigns tasks to relevant members
- Sends task details via Email, Slack, or Microsoft Teams

### âœ… Automated Follow-Up

High-level architecture
	â€¢	macOS JavaFX client (UI, local notifications, OAuth initiation for calendar) â†” Spring Boot Backend (REST + WebSocket)
	â€¢	MySQL (JPA/Hibernate) for persistent data (meetings, tasks, participants, history)
	â€¢	Whisper microservice (Python) â€” accepts audio file, returns transcript (REST)
	â€¢	Meeting Join Bot (external process: Python/Node using headless browser or Zoom SDK) to join calls and record audio; reports audio file URL to backend
	â€¢	OpenAI (or Gemini) client invoked by backend to summarize/transcribe-clean/produce MoM & tasks
	â€¢	Email (Spring Mail) / Slack / Teams clients for notifications & interactive commands
	â€¢	Docker + Kubernetes for deployment (backend, whisper, bot workers)
	â€¢	Security: OAuth2 for calendar APIs; Spring Security with JWT/OAuth2 for API endpoints
